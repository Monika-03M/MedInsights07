The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep one packet A  B at pm Wednesday evening and then another packet AB starting from am Thursday On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at ml a time over  to  hours On each occasion I was also to take ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels ndash nondiet carbonated drinks ie Coca Cola Lucozade or ginger ale any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice but NOT other fruit juices water alone not being sufficient A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets A  B with  litre of water in a large jug It tasted mildly of lemon but because of warnings about taste I downed each ml in seconds rather than sip it so as not to have to agonise over the taste Starting at am the fourth dose was finished at pm The drug started having an effect at about pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about  to  hours I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at am and two more occasions up to am though not in so much of a hurry I took the ml of water after the final dose and about ml of Lucozade after that  I was also told to use what we in the UK call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks This I did not do but regretted it Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends
